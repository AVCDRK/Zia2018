Here are some research questions:

What does the frequency of scorpion activity (capture rate) looks like over time (plotted per month)?
What environmental factors affect the presence or absence of scorpions?
What percentage of scorpions are found in open area vs in vegetation?
Does wind speed (above ground and close to ground) affect scorpion presence in vegetation?
What is the average distance of scorpions from nearest vegetation? and does %lunar illumination, wind sped, temp affect that?
